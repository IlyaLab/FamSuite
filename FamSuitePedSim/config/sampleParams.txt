# Configuration File for CIFBAT Ped Simulation
# Notes:
#   Must have a tab after the param name.
#   Param names are fixed.
#   Multiple params must be comma separated.
#   Fractional numbers must have a decimal.
#   For backgroundPenetrance, penetranceParams,
#     order is: mean,sd for each population
#   Risk ratios: S->0  G -> 1
#     mcar for missing type:  use missingParam1 for fraction missing variants 0.01 (for 1%)
#     mar  for missing type: use missingParam1 for frac. missing,
#          missingParam2 indicates the missingness type â€¦ 1/0 for gender  P1/P0 for population
#     mnar for missing type: use CC for case control and HH for het
