# Configuration File for CIFBAT Ped Simulation
# Note:
# Must have a tab after the param name.
# Param names are fixed.
# Multiple params must be comma separated.
# Fractional numbers must have a decimal.
# For backgroundPenetrance, penetranceParams,
#    order is: mean,sd for each population
# Risk ratios: S->0  G -> 1
# mcar for missing type:  use missingParam1 for fraction missing variants 0.01 (for 1%)
# mar  for missing type: use missingParam1 for frac. missing,
#          missingParam2 indicates the missingness type â€¦ 1/0 for gender  P1/P0 for population
# mnar for missing type: use CC for case control and HH for het
